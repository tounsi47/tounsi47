Hello world, I'm Saad Tounsi from Morocco.😀️😀️
I already had another account, but I deleted it, and now I'm in my new fresh profile with all my projects.😁️
I mastered python 2 years and I still mastering...Now I can create graphic apps😅️
I like discovering the linux world😍️, I use ubuntu in my desktop computer and fedora on my laptop, over time I can work in terminal and sometimes in console, I found it so interesting🤩️.
My dream is to make my future linux operating system like ubuntu or red hat,  I'm far from realizing my dream 😥️but I must not give up😲️, there is still hope ...
As you seen my first repository, I master python and start in pascal, but already in c++ and java, and even more soon😉️
