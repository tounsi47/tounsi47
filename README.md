Hello world, I'm Saad Tounsi from Morocco.  I already had another account, but I deleted it, and now I'm in my new fresh profile with my backed up projects.If you want to know ,the name of my old profile was "tounsi-zorin" (I was using zorin OS in 2022-2023).
I mastered python 2 years and I still mastering ... Now I can create graphic apps. I like discovering the open-source world (linux) , since 2022. I actually use linux both in my desktop computer and  my laptop, over time I can work in terminal and sometimes in console, I found it so interesting😍️. And also, I begin to mastering the BASH to automatise tasks and commands in linux, is the top of fun 🤩️.
I don't like any linux distros, my favourites linux distros are : Ubuntu(1), Fedora(2) , kubuntu(3) and zorin os(4) 
My dream is to make my future linux operating system, I plan to make an easier, more secure and stable operating system, with my own DE, my own package manager, and my own runtime and my own programs. Of course I'm far realizing my dream because it's could take a long time, but I must give up, there is still hopes for the moment ... I have to take my chance.
As you seen my first repository in my profile, I master python and start in pascal, but already in c++ and java, and even more soon 😉️.
